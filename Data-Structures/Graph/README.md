# Graphs

Implementing the Graph data structure and some of its most popular methods. This data structure currently only supports uni-directional edges.

## Space and Time Complexity

- AddVertex

Adds a vertex to graph without edges.
>Time : O(1)

>Space : O(1)

- AddEdge

Adds edge between two vertices
>Time: O(1)

>Space: O(1)

- GetVertices

Gets all the vertices in graph
>Time: O(1)

>Space: O(n)

- GetNeighbors

Gets all the vertices connected to a given vertex
>Time: O(1)

>Space: O(1)

- Size

Adds node after a target node
>Time: O(1)

>Space: O(1)

## Uses

Graphs are one of the most common data structures around. Some uses include traffic data, social media, and geographic mapping.
