# Merge Sort

An array sorting method.

## Challenge

Write a function called MergeSort that sorts a given unsorted away in insertion fashion.

## Approach and Efficiency

Time Complexity: O(n logn)
> Time complexity is O(n logn) due to main method utilizing helper functions that break arrays down in halves while calling itself recursively.

Space Complexity: O(n)
