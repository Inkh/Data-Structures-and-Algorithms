# Insertion Sort

An array sorting method.

## Challenge

Write a function called InsertionSort that sorts a given unsorted away in insertion fashion.

## Approach and Efficiency

Time Complexity: O(n)
> Time complexity is O(n^2) due to having the need to nest while loops in for loops to shift each element.

Space Complexity: O(1)
> Space complexity is constant as we're manipulating the array in place.
