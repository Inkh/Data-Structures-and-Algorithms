# Find Max

Finds the max value in a binary tree.

## Challenge

Write a function called FindMaxValue which takes binary tree as its only input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach and Efficiency

Time Complexity: O(h)
> Time complexity is O(h) depending on the height of tree.

Space Complexity: O(1)
> Space complexity constant as we're only keeping track of the max value.
