# Quick Sort

An array sorting method.

## Challenge

Write a function called QuickSort that sorts a given unsorted array in quicksort fashion.

## Approach and Efficiency

Time Complexity: O(n logn)
> Time complexity O(n logn) on best and average cases, but at worst can be O(n^2).

Space Complexity: O(log(n))
> Space complexity O(log(n)).
